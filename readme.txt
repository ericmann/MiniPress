Automatically concatenates and minifies all enqueued scripts upon pageload.

== Description ==

Concatenation merges multiple JavaScript files into one. This means the browser downloads 1 file instead of 5, 10, or 20.

Minification removes all unnecessary space from a file. This means you only download the content you actually need.

To speed up your site, most developers will recommend you do both.  But it can be time-consuming and frustrating to set this
up - particularly as you install new plugins on your site.

Rather than forcing you to merge and minify files manually, this plugin will do it for you automatically.  No configuration
is needed, just activate and go.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
