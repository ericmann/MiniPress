MiniPress
=========

Automatically concatenates and minifies all enqueued scripts upon pageload.

Description
-----------

Concatenation merges multiple JavaScript files into one. This means the browser downloads 1 file instead of 5, 10, or 20.

Minification removes all unnecessary space from a file. This means you only download the content you actually need.

To speed up your site, most developers will recommend you do both.  But it can be time-consuming and frustrating to set this
up - particularly as you install new plugins on your site.

Rather than forcing you to merge and minify files manually, this plugin will do it for you automatically.  No configuration
is needed, just activate and go.

Installation
------------

**Easy Installation**

Search for "MiniPress" in the WordPress 'Plugins' menu.

**Manual Installation**

1. Upload the entire `/minipress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**How does SCRIPT_DEBUG work for developers?**

If `SCRIPT_DEBUG` is set to true in the configuration file, then scripts will be concatenated but they will not be
minified.

**What about stylesheets?**

For now they're left alone. This will (hopefully) come in a later version.
